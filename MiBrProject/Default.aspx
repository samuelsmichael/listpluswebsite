       Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="main-body">
       Thank you for your interest in <span class="product-emphasis">Intelligent Reminder</span>.  We hope that this product becomes a part 
       of your ever-expanding repetoire of personal Android-based <i>Smart Phone</i> productivity apps.  It was certainly conceived of for that purpose.
       </p>
       <p class="titular-medium">
       History
       </p>
       <p class="main-body">
       What brought about the conception of <span class="product-emphasis">Intelligent Reminder</span>?  Anyone who owns a <i>Smart Phone</i> of any brand can certainly remember
       the sense of awe you experienced as you became exposed to more and more of its capabilities.  It was reminiscent of being
       16 years old again, and just starting to drive.  What power!  What independence!  The truth is that <i>Smart Phones</i> do indeed
       open you up to a new world of productivity possibilities.  
       </p>
       <p>
       The co-author of <span class="product-emphasis">Intelligent Reminder</span> had an IPhone, and was particularly struck by this idea
       of being able to download independently written applications ... which, at the time,
       put the IPhone in a class by itself.  Being of a productivity-sensitive nature, he soon conceived of a 
       simple, yet highly effective app for his phone  ... something that so obviously blended and enhanced today's conditions of life   
       as to almost be a paradigm-shift.  <img  src="images/promo3.png" align="right" style="padding:5px;" /> He couldn't wait to get his hands on one of them! How much time this was going to
       save him -- daily!  Imagine his dismay when, search as he may, he couldn't find one that fit this simple idea. It was
       only much later that he realized the reason for this: such an app -- though quite simple in nature -- nevertheless, necessitated
       a kind of technological power that the IPhone
       just plain doesn't have.  Thankfully, Google came on the scene and manufactured the Android operating system, opening the 
       door for this app, and many others like it which will bring the <i>Smart Phone</i> to a new level, far surpassing the IPhone.

       <p class="titular-medium">
       So, what's this "paradigm-shifting" idea, anyway?
       </p>
       <p>
       The best way to tell you is to describe a condition very common in today's world, and then let you judge for yourself if <span class="product-emphasis">Intelligent Reminder</span>
       indeed effectively addresses this condition.
       </p>
       <p>
       You've planned on running some errands on the way home from work.  You can pick up the dog-food and kitty litter at the Pet's 
       Mart, and there's an Office Mate right <img src="images/launcher_icon.png" width="66" height="66" style="padding:6px;" align="left" />next 
       door ... so you can get those ink cartridges you need.  Lastly, you duck into the
       food store to pick up the rest of the things on your list.  (Good thing you made a list this morning while you were fresh,
       because you're pretty tired at this point of the day.)  You get home, unpack, get ready to relax, and then realize that 
       you're almost out of coffee.  "<b>Dang! </b> And there was a Starbucks right there, too!"</p>
       <p>
       How often does this kind of event happen to you?  Once a day?  Twice?  It used to happen to the co-author of <span class="product-emphasis">Intelligent Reminder</span> <i>at least</i> once
       a day.  So when he got his <i>Smart Phone</i> he thought, "Given that my phone is aware of where I am located, all I need is
       a simple app that let's me build a small database of "locations" over time, and then, at the moment I see that we need, say,
       coffee, I'll whip out my <i>Smart Phone</i>, key in coffee, and then designate some of the many places I know that I can
       get what I want.  All I want is for my <i>Smart Phone</i> to then give me a little reminder ... "Are you aware that you're presently
       located quite close to where you can pick up <i>such-and-such</i>?  An app that takes advantage of the <i>Smart Phone</i>
       like that, would save me <i>easily</i>15 minutes a day!  How much would saving 15 minutes/day for the rest of your life
       be worth?  
       </p>
        <p>
        Well, happy days!  MiBr Technological Services, combined with Google's advanced Android operating system, have brought this
        app to you ... and for the incredibly low price of $7.99.
