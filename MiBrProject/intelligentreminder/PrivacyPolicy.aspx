Privacy Policy of <i>Intelligent Reminder</i>
</p>

<ul class="body-emphasis">
    <li>We do not collect any private information whatsoever, and have nothing to share with anybody.</li>
    <li>We do collect usage of the product uniquely for the purpose of studying the usage of our product, in the hopes that we can find places
        where it might need enhancement.</li>
    <li>We do maintain a log of activity taking place.  You have control in Prefernces of the level of logging you wish to have occurring ... all
        the way from "Log Everything" to "Turn off loging".  This log only gets transmitted when you choose to do so (at the System tab), 
        of if a crash occurs ... which log we then can use to help us identify the few (if any) bugs still in the system.  It is possible, therefore,
        that if you have a high enough logging level, and we receive that information, that we would have statistics about where you've
        travelled.  However, rest assured that we do not share this information to anybody.  It's all just a means of known what's
        going on in your machine, to help us debug the few, if any, still remainging bugs.</li>
    <li><i>Intelligent Reminder</i> alerts you to those items at the time when you are in the vicinity of any one of the locations.</li>
    <li>Enter things you need to talk about and associate them with one or more contacts.  When that person calls, or when you call
    that person, a popup reminding will show up at the same time (and stay there until you press Close), remindinn you of what you wished to talk about.</li>
