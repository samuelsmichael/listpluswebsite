  <p class="policy-statement">All software -- especially software written for the general public -- starts off as a young child.  It needs to be nurtured to grow.  The way that software grows is through the successful relationship between the user and the author.  We at MiBr promise to do everything possible to honor that relationship.  All cancellations are honored.  All requests for enhancements are honored.  And especially ... all bugs are fixed.  No questions asked.
